# An Introduction to [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/)

Code and notes from the egghead.io [Cycle.js Fundamentals](https://egghead.io/series/cycle-js-fundamentals) videos.

ES6 is transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and bundled with [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup).

Bundle produced for this template is 6kb larger than that produced by babelify. Maybe Rollup will make a bigger difference in a larger application.

Using npm as the build tool,[see](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/).

No hot module replacement not yet implemented.

Develop: `npm run watch`, [Open in browser](http://localhost:8080) 

Test: `npm test`

Install/Production: `npm run install`

Test Install: `npm run server`
